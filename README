DEPRECATED
==========

This package has not been maintained for going on 15 years.

You probably aren't using it.

If you are, you shouldn't; there are many alternatives now which are actively maintained by people who are still engaged in space science.

I am currently browning out the package by unpublishing it from PyPI in order to relinquish the name to another project.  If this breaks your setup, let me know loudly and promptly.
