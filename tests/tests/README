Automated tests designed to be run by the "validate" script.
The two-tiered "tests" directory is important because the script tries to
help out by adding the parent directory of "tests" to the PYTHONPATH
environment variable, which actually doesn't help us at all if we add the
directory of the unbuilt extension, and causes lots of spurious failures due
to namespace conflicts.
