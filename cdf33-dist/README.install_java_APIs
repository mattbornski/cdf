                   CDF Version 3.3, UNIX/POSIX Systems

The CDF distribution package now contains the CDF Java APIs, in addition to 
the existing C and Fortran APIs, to allow users to develop platform-independent
CDF applications.  By default, the Java APIs are not installed as part of
standard installation, and the APIs can be installed by following the 
installation instructions listed below. 

Documentation for the CDF Java APIs is available at 
    http://cdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/cdfjava_doc/index.html.
 

***************************************************************************
*   Please make sure that you have done the following before proceeding   *
*   with the CDF Java APIs installation:                                  * 
*                                                                         *
*     - installed the JDK 1.5 or later.                                   *
*     - untarred the CDF distribution package                             *
*     - installed the CDF distribution package using the 'make' command   *
*       from the cdf33_0-dist directory.  Make sure that CDF is compiled  *
*       with shared library support.                                      *
*     - executed the definitions.C file located under the cdf33_0-dist/bin*
*       directory (e.g. `source definitions.C' for C shell).  This file   *
*       defines the environment variables (e.g. CDF_BASE, CDF_LIB, etc)   *
*       that are used by the installation instructions described below.   *

Installation instructions of the CDF Java APIs
----------------------------------------------
1. Set your current directory (cd) to the top level CDF directory
   (the directory named `cdf33_0-dist' created by `tar').

2. If you downloaded a tar file that contains both the CDF library and the
   CDF Java APIs (i.e. cdf33_0-dist-all.tar), go to step 3. 
 
   Untar the CDF Java APIs, cdf33_0-dist-java.tar, as follows:
      tar xvf cdf33_0-dist-java.tar  

3. Set your current directory (cd) to the cdfjava/jni directory.  

4. Compile the JNI code, cdfNativeLibrary.c. If gcc is used, specify the option
   "-m32" or "-m64" to comiple it into 32/64-bit object. Or, use the default by
   not specifying any option, which will compile the code into the same mode as
   the iunderling system. Command to compile is as follows:

   cc -c cdfNativeLibrary.c 
      -I${CDF_BASE}/include 
      -I<Java include directory for jni.h> 
      -I<Java include directory for jni_md.h> 
      -o cdfNativeLibrary.o 

   NOTE: During compilation, you may get the following warning message or 
         something similar on some platforms.  Don't be alarmed about the 
         message and proceed to the next step.

         "cdfNativeLibrary.c: In function `getJavaField':
          cdfNativeLibrary.c:398: warning: assignment discards 
                                           qualifiers from pointer target type"

   Examples:
      The examples below assume that the appropriate environmental variables
      have been properly defined.  The CDF_BASE and CDF_LIB variables are 
      defined in the definitions.<shell> file located under the cdf33_0-dist/bin 
      directory.  The JAVA_HOME environment variable refers to the name of
      the root/base directory where the Java virtual machine is installed.

      If you have Linux on a PC, the following command will compile the JNI 
      code:

           gcc -I${CDF_BASE}/include -fPIC \
               -I${JAVA_HOME}/include \
               -I${JAVA_HOME}/include/linux \
               -c cdfNativeLibrary.c 

      If you have Linux on a PPC, the following command will compile the JNI
      code into 32-bit mode:

           gcc -I${CDF_BASE}/include -fPIC \
               -I${JAVA_HOME}/include \
               -I${JAVA_HOME}/include/linux \
               -c cdfNativeLibrary.c

      For 64-bit mode, add "-m64" option.

      For a Sun OS or Solaris sparc, the following command
      will compile the JNI code into 32-bit mode (using Sun's compiler):

           cc -DSOLARIS -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -Kpic \
              -I${CDF_BASE}/include \
              -I${JAVA_HOME}/include \
              -I${JAVA_HOME}/include/solaris \
              -c cdfNativeLibrary.c

      For a Solaris sparc, the following command 
      will compile the JNI code into 64-bit mode (using Sun's compiler):

           cc -DSOLARIS -DSOLARIS64 -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -xarch=v9a -Kpic \
              -I${CDF_BASE}/include \
              -I${JAVA_HOME}/include \
              -I${JAVA_HOME}/include/solaris \
              -c cdfNativeLibrary.c

      For a Solaris sparc (8/9), the following command
      will compile the JNI code into 64-bit mode (using Gnu's gcc compiler):

           gcc -DSOLARIS -DSOLARIS64 -m64 -fpic \
               -I${CDF_BASE}/include \
               -I${JAVA_HOME}/include \
               -I${JAVA_HOME}/include/solaris 
               -c cdfNativeLibrary.c

      If you have OSF1 on a DEC Alpha, the following command will compile the 
      JNI code:

           gcc -I${CDF_BASE}/include \
               -I${JAVA_HOME}/include/java \
               -I${JAVA_HOME}/include/java/alpha \
               -c cdfNativeLibrary.c
	   (You may need to include "-pthread" option if you use DEC's C 
            compiler.)

      If you are using the IBM JDK under Linux, the following command
      will compile the JNI code:

           cc -I${CDF_BASE}/include \
              -I${JAVA_HOME}/include \
              -I${JAVA_HOME}/include/linux \
              -c cdfNativeLibrary.c

      If you are using Mac OS X, the following command will compile the 
      JNI code as well as create a shared library. It covers both this 
      step and next step (go to step 6 after successful execution): 

      (Refer Apple's "Mac OS X GM Release Notes: Java" for more information.)

           Power PC
           --------
           gcc -isysroot/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -arch ppc 
               -D__MACH__ -D__APPLE__ -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 
               -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE  
               -bundle -I/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Headers 
               -I../../src/include -I. 
               -framework JavaVM 
               -o ../lib/libcdfNativeLibrary.jnilib 
               ../../lib/libcdf.dylib cdfNativeLibrary.c
 
           Intel Mac
           ---------
           gcc -isysroot/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -arch i386 -Di386 
               -D__MACH__ -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE 
               -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE  
               -bundle -I/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Headers 
               -I../../src/include -I.  
               -framework JavaVM 
               -o ../lib/libcdfNativeLibrary.jnilib 
               ../../lib/libcdf.dylib cdfNativeLibrary.c


   NOTE: The include path is slightly different depending upon which 
         JDK version and operating system you use.  

5. Create a shared library for the JNI code just compiled as follows:

   If you are using OSF1, Linux, Irix5|6, or AIX, use the following 
   command:

        ld -shared cdfNativeLibrary.o \ 
           -o ../lib/libcdfNativeLibrary.so -L${CDF_LIB} -lc -lm -lcdf

   For 64-bit mode on Linux PPC, add "-melf64ppc" option.

   If you are using a Solaris or Sun OS, use the following 
   command to make a 32-bit mode library:

         ld -G cdfNativeLibrary.o \
            -o ../lib/libcdfNativeLibrary.so -L${CDF_LIB} -lc -lm -lcdf

   If you are using a Solaris sparc (8|9), use the following command for
   Sun's linker to make a 64-bit mode library:

         ld -G cdfNativeLibrary.o -64 -L/usr/lib/sparcv9 \
            -o ../lib/libcdfNativeLibrary.so -L${CDF_LIB} -lc -lm -lcdf

   Note: assume that 64-bit library is at /usr/lib/sparcv9.

   If you are using a Solaris sparc (8|9), use the following command for
   Gnu's gcc linker to make a 64-bit mode library:

         gcc -G cdfNativeLibrary.o -m64 -L/usr/local/gcc-3.2/lib/sparcv9 \
             -o ../lib/libcdfNativeLibrary.so -L${CDF_LIB} -lc -lm -lcdf

   Note: assume that Gnu's 64-bit library is at /usr/local/gcc-3.2/lib/sparcv9.

   If you are using HP-UX, use the following command:

         ld -b cdfNativeLibrary.o \
            -o ../lib/libcdfNativeLibrary.sl -L${CDF_LIB} -lc -lm -lcdf

6. Set the CLASSPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH (DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH for Mac OS X)
   environment variables.

   1) CLASSPATH should point to the following file(s):
      - the location (full path name) of the cdfjava.jar file that is included
        in cdfjava.tar.  It's located in the cdfjava/classes directory. 

      Example:
         setenv CLASSPATH ${CLASSPATH}:.: \
                          /home/cdf/cdf33_0-dist/cdfjava/classes/cdfjava.jar

      Optionally, if the Java-based CDF tools will be used, then also include 
      CDFToolsDriver.jar in the CLASSPATH. This jar file resides in the 
      cdfjava/cdftools directory.
         
   2) LD_LIBRARY_PATH should point to the following files:
      - the location (full path name) of the libcdfNativeLibrary.[so|sl|jnilib]
        created in step 5 (it should be under cdfjava/lib) 

      - the location (full path name) of the CDF library (libcdf.[so|sl|jnilib]
        that is defined by the environment variable CDF_LIB that is defined when 
        the CDF library is installed.

      Example: 
         setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH .:/home/cdf/cdf33_0-dist/cdfjava/lib:${CDF_LIB} 

         Or for Mac OS X,

         setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH .:/Users/cdf/cdf33_0-dist/cdfjava/lib:${CDF_LIB}
